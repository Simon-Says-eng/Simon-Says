      <description>About Simon Who is Simon? Simon is a guy who lives in Germany. Simon is not like everyone. Simon always tries to think different. Every day, I am asking myself, what do you do the whole day and what should you do. Most of my time i am a guy who edits and fills forms for offices and office people. In the other quarter of my day i try to develop electronics or software.</description>

      <description>Contact Like Simon in the movie, i don&amp;rsquo;t want to be contacted for every wrong word on this site. But i am always interested for comments to my mind games. If someone wants to contact me you can try it through the given mail adress. Sometimes i will look to the inbox and answer when it is useful for me or the blog.</description>
